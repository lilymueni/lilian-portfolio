            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I completed my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Communication Engineering at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology from January 2016 to December 2022. This program provided me with a solid foundation in electrical engineering principles, including power distribution and communication systems. Additionally, I am currently expanding my skill set by pursuing coursework in software engineering. I believe that integrating software engineering skills with my electrical engineering background will allow me to leverage the power of technology more effectively. With software engineering knowledge, I can design and develop embedded systems and IoT solutions that are not only robust in hardware but also efficient and adaptable in software. This combination of skills will enable me to contribute effectively to the development of smart and innovative solutions in the field of electrical and embedded systems engineering.
